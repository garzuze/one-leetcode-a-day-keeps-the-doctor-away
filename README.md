# One LeetCode a day keeps the doctor away!

This is just a dump repo to store my LeetCode solutions and improve them when possible. 
Since I am not actively grinding, I usually choose one topic and try to solve any question related to it.
When I have more time, I pick one problem from NeetCode's curated lists. 
I'll keep a mirror of my progress in the NeetCode 150 here.
